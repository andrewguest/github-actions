### About

---

This is an example of how to run PyTest tests against some Python code. The GitHub Actions workflow file for this is `.github/workflows/python-example-workflow.yml` in the root of this repo.

This folder contains a simple Python script, `app/counter.py`, that takes 2 numbers as inputs and returns their sum.

The `tests` directory contains a test script that supplies `counter.py` with 2 numbers and expects to receive the sum of these two number as a result.
